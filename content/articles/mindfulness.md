# Mindfulness: a creative approach

Writing about mindfulness has been a rewarding work, as it helps  me to organize ideas about my own meditation and how to use it with my clients. 

Over the years I have learnt that understanding the little differences of emphasis of the practice can help us to guide therapeutic processes better, making the focus of attention match the problems our clients are bringing.

I work with the idea that a well attuned mindfulness practice, tailor made for a client, makes it interesting and rewarding. 

I have also mixed a few practices together, which allows me to move between a more traditional mindfulness, towards a focusing emotional processing, to a body awareness, to an active imagination. 

Every one of these options are coming from different therapeutic traditions, but it is easy to blend them in the same meditation practice, allowing us to intuitively move with whatever is coming up in the moment. 

I find mindfulness useful in multiple areas of work: cognitive rumination, embodied trauma, unconscious processing and emotional awareness.

I see mindfulness as a creative space, and I feel that working with it in that way makes it more interesting and approachable. 

Mindfulness has its roots in spiritual practices, aiming for deep transformations in the subjects. This means that many of this practices have the potential to alter your consciousness and sometimes trigger difficult experiences. 

I always work with the awareness that Mindfulness has great power, but that means great risk too. Sometimes we go into dissociation, into strange body feelings, or into dream-like spaces. Some people may get more triggered with the practice because there is some underlying trauma, and the silence and focus on the body made them feel too vulnerable. Some may try it and feel it boring, or meaningless, because it was introduced as a repetitive and submissive practice. 

For these reasons I believe that making mindfulness a tailored experience, making it fit what clients are looking for and needing, and explaining well the possible risk, so you do not keep going in that direction when it happens, makes it a safe practice.
