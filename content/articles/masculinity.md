# About masculinity and parents

This is a topic I have writen only one paper about, but I think it has been influencial in my work, and it is a topic I come back to in my mind, as it affects me every day. 

I think we are living in a time of big cultural changes, where our definitions of what it means to be a man and a woman are in constant tension. I feel myself wondering that does it mean to be a man, who is sensitive, delicate and caring, and how does it fit with the cultural expectations of manhood that tend towards agression and assertiveness.

More than once I have wondered if the pronoun 'he' defines me, as I feel the constrains of these words sometimes make me feel reduced to a small definition.

The paper I wrote with another to scholars reflects in how our cultural definition of masculinity has lead to man have more mental and phisical health problems. The lack of emotional and relational intelligence tends to lock men into an isolated spaces to deal with emotional conflicts. 

We explored some literature that has been showing these sad correlations, but more importantly we wrote about our dads, and their suffering. We reflected through poems on the legacy of those old models of masculinity and how they keep impacting our identity, in the memories of our upbringing.
