## What is CreaTherapy?

CreaTherapy is a new way of understanding psychotherapy. In the history of psychotherapy we have seen many changes and many branches emerge. This proliferation has been seen as a problem for many, and has caused many battles inside the profession. 

One solution I tried for years is called 'integration', and there are variations like 'eclectisism' and 'pluralism'. I feel that with these models we are going somewhere, but that is far from what I see in the day to day, and on what I talk with my colleagues. 

Most of us are feeling a bit part of a tradition, as we have trained in them. But also we are reading, going to courses and watching videos of other traditions. We are at a point in our culture where information flies fast, and the old traditions do not have the time to catch up with all we are learning. 

CreaTherapy aims to face the challenge in an original way: instead of trying to contain the proliferation and inter breeding of approaches, what if we move foward to systems that allow and encurage individual discovery and development. Which means, we encurage the creations of personal projects, personal approaches and styles. 

This, of course generate new problems, like we need some basic knoledge to not mess things up. So, I am working in a framwork that organises some of the main therapeutic areas of knoledge, and gives direction to the learning of them. It also helps therapist to track their learning of an area, so we can have a notion of progress wihtout being rigid about the tradition from where it is comming from.
