## A bit about this site

I have made this site from scratch, by programming each part. 

I have not used AI, except by some checks that my IDLE (app for coding) has on the background (checking some coding spelling and basic mistakes). 

I use a Python base (with the framework Django) that helps me render the html from a  markdown file system.

I also use Bootstrap to style each part (give it colour and nice shapes) and for it to look more modern, with a base called 'Solar', that I manipulated a little. Boostrap combines some HTML, CSS and Javascript to render things more nicely, but gives lots of space for costumisation (and it is still a code base framework).
