## A bit about this site

I have made this site from scratch by programming each part. 

I have not used AI, except for some checks that my IDLE (app for coding) has on the background (checking some coding spelling and basic mistakes). 

I use a Python base (with the Django framework) to render HTML from a Markdown file system.

I also use Bootstrap to style each part (give it colour and nice shapes) and make it look more modern, with a base called 'Solar' that I manipulated a little. Boostrap combines some HTML, CSS, and Javascript to render things more nicely, but it gives lots of space for customisation (and it is still a code-base framework).
