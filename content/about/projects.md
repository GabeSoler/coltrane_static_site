My current projects are to continue working in my private practice and as part of a group of Spanish-speaking therapists ([Psicologia en Edimburgo](https://psicologiaenedimburgo.com/)) and to develop the ideas that were born in my PhD into something more grounded and practical. 

This more practical way of thinking has led me to develop a new approach to psychotherapy that aims to be different from any other because it encourages practitioners to develop their own approaches. 

This sounds a bit confusing, but instead of giving a recipe, try to write about how to make your own recipes. 

[CreaTherapy](https://crea-therapy.com/)

The main idea of CreaTherapy is to create a theory/practice that allows therapists to explore more deeply their unique styles while finding a way to find knowledge to back up those explorations. 


These two are interlinked, as one feeds the other. Doing it all myself gives me a lot of freedom, but it is also a lot of work sometimes, and I need to switch between quite different ways of thinking.
