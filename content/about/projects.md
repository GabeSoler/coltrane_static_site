My current projects are on one side to keep working in my private practice and as part of a group of spanish speaking therapists ([Psicologia en Edimburgo](https://psicologiaenedimburgo.com/)), and on the other, to keep developing the ideas that where born in my PhD into something more grounded and practical. 

This more practical way of thinking has lead me to develop a new approach to psychotherapy, that is actually aiming to not be an approach like any other, because it promotes the practicioner to develop their own approach. 

This sounds a bit confusing, but its instead of giving a receipe try to write about how to make your own recepies. 

[CreaTherapy](https://crea-therapy.com/)

The main idea of CreaTherapy is to create a theorety/practice that allows therapist to explore more feely their unique styles at the same time to have a way of finding knoledge to back up those explorations. 


These two are interlinked as one is feeding the other. I feel lots of freedom by doing it all myself, but it is also lots of work sometimes, and I need to be switching between quite different ways of thinking.
