My current projects beside my practice are about CreaTherapy, a new approach to psychotherapy. I am taking the ideas of my PhD and moving them forward, but in a more practical way. I have learned how to code and I am developing a WebApp for it. 

One of the main differences of this approach is to encourage therapist to develop their own approaches, while giving strong theoretical and practical foundations for it. 

[CreaTherapy](https://crea-therapy.com/)

Together with the WebApp I am writing the theory behind, and I hope to have that site up soon.
