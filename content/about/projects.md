My current projects are:
- Write the CreaTherapy approach
- Code the CreaTherapy App

These two are interlinked as one is feeding the other. I feel lots of freedom by doing it all myself, but it is also lots of work sometimes, and I need to be switching between quite different ways of thinking. 

The main idea of CreaTherapy is to create a theorety/practice that allows therapist to explore more feely their unique styles at the same time to have a way of finding knoledge to back up those explorations.
