## A bit about me
Hi, this section is to talk a little about myself. You can also explore other related content up in the navegation panel. 

Lets start with a bit of background. I was born and raised in Chile, having at the same time Spanish and Italian nationality. I grew up being  a shy and intelectual kid, who loved books and was doing well at school. I also practiced many things as I was growing up, like the flute, painting, playing basketball, writing, etc. 

I always loved arts and creativity, the feeling of being in the flow, solving things in inspiration and feeling that the world is only existing in that moment.

When I was making my decition about what to study I chose psychology because it had many things I liked, and I liked way too many things. The ones that I appreciated where:
- It had humanities and sciences,
- It was related to working closely with people
- It could answer many philosophical questions,
- I thought it would help me to understand characters,
- and get inspiration for my art. 
  
So my interest was quite varied. I also took other activities as I studied, like art classes in the art department, swimming for a year, and then martial arts with some friends. 

At that time the seeds of my ways of thinking where taking shape. I liked authors that explored creativity, play, and spontaneity. I liked when there was philosophy, but also when there was new discoveries that fascinated me.

After finishing my undergrad plus practical masters, I trained in an integrative approach to psychotherapy. There I grew as a therapist, seeing clients, having supervision and learning the model. 

I developed many ideas during that time, as I continued working and studing in the instutie for Integrative Studies. I worked at the begining with the idea of development, because I wanted to really understand how do we change so much from childhood to adulhood. I also wanted to understand the work of Ken Wilber, someone I found fascinating back then, because he mixed oriental spirituality with evolutionary psychology. 

I arrived to slightly different conclusions to Wilber, as I saw developmnet as something more flexible, more playful, and I was also searching for something another author sparked in me: my true self. 

The work of Donald Winnicott insipired me since I read his first words. He focuses on playing, creativity, instict, spontaneity, and developed a way of doing psychoanalisis with those values. One of his central concepts is the True Self, as a creative core inside all of us.

These mix of ideas have been showing in my published works, and my own development as a therapist. From the beginign I have incorporated techniques that allow me more creative exploration. I intrudoced drawing space, and active imagination to my practice quite early on. And over time I grew curius about how far these ideas could go. 

That is what brought me to Edinbugh. I came to develop a research into Transitionality, the theoretical concept that Winnicott developed to study creativity. I worked hard for four years in my research, while also doing tutoring and working in a charity in Leith. 

The theory I developed tooks Winnicott's way foward, at the same time that makes it close to all of us. My exploration into transitionality, moved the concepts to a more philosophical plane, and therefore it can be applied to most human meaninful experiences.

In short, transitionality means that we create a space between reality and fantasy. These space in inhabited by objects, like your toys, when you are little, and then by cultural experience, as you grow up. These makes a turning in our understanding of the unconcious: it is not inside where we look, but into the objects where the transitional space expands.

These idea was some sort of a relief. I finally could understand my own need for exploration, my own path of learning things I liked, and my love for crafts and arts, and cultural experiences in general. Finally, my day to day was explained by the theories I was using in my work.

I hope this tells you a bit about me. It may help to know that I still practice drawing and painting, i play the guitar and the piano. I go swimming regularly and also enjoy watching series and movies. I have been learning how to cook, because I found fascinating you can develop concepts with your food. I also have been trying to sing, even if its hard. 

Latelly I had the crazy idea of learning to code. This one has been far the most weird of the things I have tried, but it has allowed me to develop this site on my own, and my other project CreaTherapy, were I am developing a new model to understand psychotherapy in a webapp format.
