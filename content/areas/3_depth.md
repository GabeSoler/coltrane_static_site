This is a strange title, but it points to one thing I feel characterises my practice, and that it is not that common in all my colleagues: I like to reflect and think, and bring philosohpical ideas into session.

I have been studying psychology for a long long time, log before going to university, as I was already fascinated by my mind and the minds of others as a child. 

I have not lernt the concepts and theories, as another homework, but as a fascinating exploration into our human condition. For that reason as we talk I am linking our conversation with multiple frames of reference, and I enjoy to bring them to the front and share some options of understanding. 

This does not mean that I will bring too many things, but that I like moving topics into deeper topics. I like seen patterns and offering options to make sense of things. 

I do not see it as something defining, as I always hold many paradigms and models in my mind. I see it more like a lively conversation into the misteries of youself. It works quite well and my clients enjoy the conversation. 

Some of my clients ask for more or less of this type of dialogue. Some feel quite a relief that they actually can ask for explanations of what is happening, and I enjoy expleining the different tensions of my profession and the decisions I am(or we are) making.

I work with many clients that are neurodivergent and they usually appreciate to have models and explanations of the things that 'do not make sense'. I am flexible with paradigms, which means that I may use science with one, cybernetics with another, humanities with the next. 

In general I enjoy knoledge, and to be able to wonder about the misteries of being and being together.
