Neurodiversity has become a new buzzword, and here I would like to keep it quite open. More than trying to go into the anxiety of 'do I have this or that thing' I prefer to say that my practice is open to many ways of making sense and living the world. 

This means that I am playful and flexible, and I have many alternatives about how to proceed at any given time. Some clients like the verbal experience, and we may go deep into narrating emotions, ideas, or stories. 

Other clients are less verbal and we do drawings, use stones, move our bodies, create intresting dramatisations, etc. 

For some having clear explanations of what is happening and developing a functional model seems to calm them down, and I use my years of academia to help them make sense of things at an abstract level. 

I have been making adjustements to the tecnique for years, at the same time than keeping the core components that make psychotherapy work in a safe and ethical way. 

So I am open to try new tihngs, but always from a place of coherence, where I have tried those things in me, and I have read the consequesnces and context where those practices have emerged.

Psychotherapy is so varied, and we have so many paradigms, techniques and  approaches that I can delve into different areas of the profession depending on the qualitative needs of my diverse clients.
