Some topics arrive to you as you become one of the people suffering it. 

I left my home country in 2016 and the expeirence of being a migran has been amazing, has opened my mind, and my horizons, but also has been difficult and  the same opening sometimes felt like a lot. 

I feel that being away from your culture and becoming part of a new one, make us notice little things that others seem to pass by. We become aware of so many little differences, from non-verbal comunication, rituals,  politics, group dynamics.

Many of us starts relationships with people also from other places, and we are facing even more nuanced cultural clashes, as little thigns at home, or our ways of seeing the world, sometimes seems so different. 

I have been workign with migrants since I arrived and joined a charity in Leith. I have been learning on my own life, but also listening to the lifes of others, and I have became facinated by our unique perspetive of things.

I feel that cultural and world view clashes, and understandings, pushes us foward in our development, as makes us more concious of who we are, and also of the variability of options of who we can be.
