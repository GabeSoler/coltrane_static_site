Creativity is one of my favourite topics, as it was my main exploration in my PhD and also something I like to experience myself, when I play the guitar or paint. 

Making therapy more creative has been one of my main motivations as a therapist and scholar. On one hand because I have always been into it, and also my family and friends have been always a bit artistic. On the other, because I feel the idea of a True self, proposed by Winnicott makes lots of sense to me. 

Winnicott studied childrens early engagments with toys, and their play. He proposed we need to have a creative introduction to the world to feel the world is meaningful. He saw in play the a space where our unconcious is not hidden inside or repressed, but in the world. 

For years I have been finding ways to addapt the therapeutic knoledge and different techniques to feel more authentic and playful. For this reason I like having no script in the sessions and allow the natural interaction and inspiration to guide the process. 

I have in the office many little toys, like a guitar, cards with images, stones, pencil and paper. I also like using some body work excercises, mindfulness, drama therapy, and active imagination.

I do not use all with everyone, and many times we do a lot of talking. But it feels quite liberating and nice, when things get a bit stagnant, or difficult, to use some prompts, or to delve with a more playful exercise into what is being still unformed, and still without words.

It is a bit paradoxical, but luckly quite effective, that making the difficult things to be a bit playful allow the process to move foward.

This does not mean that I work in a way that may feel too into the 'artsy' or that I would push you into activities. My base is always being in contact with what you feel, and what feels right in the moment. I never like to force things, and the exercises flow quite natural when offered in the right timing. 

I also work with a strong foundation in trauma informed approaches and years of training in clinical psychology, which gives me the confidence to notice when things need to go slower and more carefully.
