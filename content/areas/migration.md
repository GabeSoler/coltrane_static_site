Some topics arrive to you as you become one of the people suffering. 

I left my home country in 2016, and the experience of being a migrant has been amazing. It has opened my mind and horizons, but it has also been difficult, and the same opening sometimes felt like a lot. 

Being away from your culture and becoming part of a new one makes us notice little things others seem to pass by. We become aware of many differences, from nonverbal communication to rituals, politics, and group dynamics.

Many of us start relationships with people from other places, and we face even more nuanced cultural clashes, as little things at home or our ways of seeing the world sometimes seem so different. 

Since I arrived and joined a charity in Leith, I have been working with migrants. I have learned about my own life but also listened to the lives of others, and I have become fascinated by our unique perspective of things.

I feel that cultural and worldview clashes and understandings push us forward in our development, making us more conscious of who we are and the variability of our options.

But this same push for growth often needs some guidance and company. Sometimes, we are on the cusp of a developmental step, making us feel fragmented and lost in who we are, what we are becoming, and how we will fit again in the world.
