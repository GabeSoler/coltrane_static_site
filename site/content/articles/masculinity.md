# Parent/child relationship

One topic I have only one paper about, but I find interesting and an intrinsic part of psychotherapy, is the parent/child relationship. 
When we explore these dynamics in session, we find so much of our identity and relational patterns are set up when we were growing up in the form of strong interactions with our parents that then repeat in structure.
In the paper linked below, two other male scholars and I reflected on our relationship with our dads, which opened a space to think about masculinity and how some of the traditional definitions of it can be detrimental for us as we grow. 


- Paper about father absences and masculinity that aims to be more feminist for our own good:
